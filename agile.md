# Agile & Scrum Method

**Agile** is also a way of thinking and a systematic approach for the rapid delivery of complex products and services. Agile minimizes risk by incremental delivery, emphasizes real time collaboration, automation, mistake proof development practices, and uses business value as the primary measure of progress.

**Scrum** is a style of Agile that provides a project management wrapper for incremental delivery of projects, independent of technology used.

## Summary of Scrum

The Scrum Team's members, the Product Owner, the Development Team, and the ScrumMaster, collaborate to create a series of Product Increments, at short time-boxed intervals called Sprints, meeting the Product Owner's acceptance criteria and the team's shared "Definition of Done". They work from a Product Backlog. In each Sprint, they begin with Sprint Planning to produce the Sprint Backlog, a plan for the Sprint. They self-organize to do the Development, using Daily Scrum meetings to coordinate and to ensure that they produce the best possible Product Increment. They perform Product Backlog Refinement to prepare for the next Sprint's planning meeting. They end the Sprint with the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective, reviewing the product and their process.

Scrum emphasizes working product at the end of the Sprint that is really “done”; in the case of software, this means a system that is integrated, fully tested, end-user documented, and potentially shippable.

## Scrum Framework

### Roles

The Scrum Team includes three roles, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the members of the Development Team.

The Product Owner is responsible for drawing out the most valuable possible product by the desired date. The Product Owner does this by managing the Product Backlog, and by ensuring that the Product Backlog, and progress against it, is kept visible.

The Development Team is responsible for determining how much work will be taken on in a Sprint, and for producing a usable Product Increment in every Sprint. The Development Team can be Feature Teams that build complete features in vertical slices of technology layers (GUI, Client, Server, Database, etc.). The Development Team is seven plus or minus two people. In Scrum the Teams are most productive and effective if all members are 100 percent dedicated to the work for one product during the Sprint.

The ScrumMaster is a "servant leader", helping the rest of the Scrum Team follow their process. The ScrumMaster removes impediments and shield the team from external interferences. The ScrumMaster does not tell people what to do or assign tasks – they facilitate the process, supporting the Team as it organizes and manages itself.

### Artifacts

Scrum includes three essential artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Product Increment.

The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of customer-centric features. It is the product roadmap. A good Product Backlog is: detailed appropriately, estimated, emergent (continuously updated), and prioritized.

User stories make great product backlog items. User stories are simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to either a user or purchaser of a product. Template: "As a \<type of user\>, I can \<Feature/function\> so that \<business value\>".

For effort estimates, a common technique is to estimate in terms of relative size ("points"). Velocity is how much work is completed each Sprint. Velocity is expressed in the same units as the Product Backlog item size estimates.

The most important Scrum artifact is the Product Increment. Every Sprint produces a Product Increment. The Product Increment must be of high enough quality to be given to users. The Product Increment must meet the Scrum Team's current Definition of Done, and each component of it be acceptable to the Product Owner.

Sprint Backlog is the list of work to be done during the Sprint.

### Activities

Scrum includes five Activities or meetings: Product Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

Product Backlog Refinement: not for items selected for the current Sprint; it is for items for the future, most likely in the next one or two Sprints.

The Sprint Planning meeting has two parts:

- Determine what work will be completed in the Sprint (the resulting list of things to do is the Sprint Backlog);
- Determine how the work will be accomplished.

Team capacity: most teams assume 4-6 hours per day for Sprint-related work.

In the Daily Scrum, each Development Team member gives three bits of information:

- What I have accomplished since our last Daily Scrum;
- What I plan to accomplish between now and our next Daily Scrum; 
- What is impeding my progress.

A follow-up meeting is a common event where some or all team members adapt to the information they heard in the Daily Scrum.

During the Sprint, no new items may be added; Scrum embraces change for the *next* Sprint, but the current Sprint is meant to focus on small, clear, relatively stable goal. Team members “go to where the work is” and help out as possible.

Spring Review: At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review the output of the Sprint.

Sprints continue until the Product Owner decides the product is ready for release.

## Scrum Principles

The Agile Manifesto values apply directly to Scrum:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**. Teams identify what's getting in their way, and they take the responsibility to resolve all the difficulties that are within its scope. Teams work with other parts of the organization to resolve the concerns that are outside their control.
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**. It is the working software that allows the organization to guide the project to success. Scrum teams must produce a product increment in every Sprint.
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**. The Scrum Product Owner is the Scrum Team's prime point of contact with the eventual end users of the product, and with the parts of the organization that need the product. The Product Owner selects the most valuable next things to do, ensuring that the product has the highest possible value at every point in time.
- **Responding to change over following a plan**. Scrum works well for teams that openly "inspect" what's going on and "adapt" their actions to the reality.

## Challenges & Mistakes

- Change Scrum (e.g., extend Sprint duration).
- Assume that a practice is discouraged or prohibited just because Scrum does not specifically require it.
- Managers impose Scrum on their Teams.
