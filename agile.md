# Agile & Scrum Method

The Scrum Team's members, the Product Owner, the Development Team, and the ScrumMaster, collaborate to create a series of Product Increments, at short time-boxed intervals called Sprints, meeting the Product Owner's acceptance criteria and the team's shared "Definition of Done". They work from a Product Backlog. In each Sprint, they begin with Sprint Planning to produce the Sprint Backlog, a plan for the Sprint. They self-organize to do the Development, using Daily Scrum meetings to coordinate and to ensure that they produce the best possible Product Increment. They perform Product Backlog Refinement to prepare for the next Sprint's planning meeting. They end the Sprint with the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective, reviewing the product and their process.

## Scrum Framework

### Roles

The Scrum Team includes three roles, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the members of the Development Team. 

The Product Owner is responsible for drawing out the most valuable possible product by the desired date. The Product Owner does this by managing the Product Backlog, and by ensuring that the Product Backlog, and progress against it, is kept visible.

The Development Team is responsible for determining how much work will be taken on in a Sprint, and for producing a usable Product Increment in every Sprint.

The ScrumMaster is a "servant leader", helping the rest of the Scrum Team follow their process.

### Artifacts

Scrum includes three essential artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Product Increment.

The most important Scrum artifact is the Product Increment. Every Sprint produces a Product Increment. The Product Increment must be of high enough quality to be given to users. The Product Increment must meet the Scrum Team's current Definition of Done, and each component of it be acceptable to the Product Owner.

### Activities

Scrum includes five Activities or meetings: Product Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

The Sprint Planning meeting has two parts:

- Determine what work will be completed in the Sprint (the resulting list of things to do is the Sprint Backlog);
- Determine how the work will be accomplished.

In the Daily Scrum, each Development Team member gives three bits of information:

- What I have accomplished since our last Daily Scrum;
- What I plan to accomplish between now and our next Daily Scrum; 
- What is impeding my progress.

Spring Review: At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review the output of the Sprint.

## Scrum Principles

The Agile Manifesto values apply directly to Scrum:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**. Teams identify what's getting in their way, and they take the responsibility to resolve all the difficulties that are within its scope. Teams work with other parts of the organization to resolve the concerns that are outside their control.
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**. It is the working software that allows the organization to guide the project to success. Scrum teams must produce a product increment in every Sprint.
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**. The Scrum Product Owner is the Scrum Team's prime point of contact with the eventual end users of the product, and with the parts of the organization that need the product. The Product Owner selects the most valuable next things to do, ensuring that the product has the highest possible value at every point in time.
- **Responding to change over following a plan**. Scrum works well for teams that openly "inspect" what's going on and "adapt" their actions to the reality.
