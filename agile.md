# Agile & Scrum Method

## Scrum Framework

### Roles

The Scrum Team includes three roles, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the members of the Development Team. 

The Product Owner is responsible for drawing out the most valuable possible product by the desired date. The Product Owner does this by managing the Product Backlog, and by ensuring that the Product Backlog, and progress against it, is kept visible.

The Development Team is responsible for determining how much work will be taken on in a Sprint, and for producing a usable Product Increment in every Sprint.

The ScrumMaster is a "servant leader", helping the rest of the Scrum Team follow their process.

### Artifacts

Scrum includes three essential artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Product Increment.

### Activities

Scrum includes five Activities or meetings: Product Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

The Sprint Planning meeting has two parts:

- Determine what work will be completed in the Sprint;
- Determine how the work will be accomplished.

## Scrum Principles

The Agile Manifesto values apply directly to Scrum:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**. Teams identify what's getting in their way, and they take the responsibility to resolve all the difficulties that are within its scope. Teams work with other parts of the organization to resolve the concerns that are outside their control.
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**. It is the working software that allows the organization to guide the project to success. Scrum teams must produce a product increment in every Sprint.
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**. The Scrum Product Owner is the Scrum Team's prime point of contact with the eventual end users of the product, and with the parts of the organization that need the product. The Product Owner selects the most valuable next things to do, ensuring that the product has the highest possible value at every point in time.
- **Responding to change over following a plan**. Scrum works well for teams that openly "inspect" what's going on and "adapt" their actions to the reality.
