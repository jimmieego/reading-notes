# Chapter 1 Introducing GIS
## Basic GIS principles
- A GIS map contains layers
- Layers may contain features or surfaces
    + Each geographic object in a layer is called a feature
    + A geographic expanse is called a surface
- Features hae shape and size
    + **Vector** data: polygon, line, point
- Surfaces have numeric values rather than shapes
    + The most common kind of surface is a **raster**, a matrix of identically sized square cells. Each cell represents a unit of surface area and contains a measured or estimated value for that location.
- Features have locations
- Features can be displayed at different sizes
- Features are linked to information
    + Features on a GIS map are linked to information in the feature's attribute table
    + The link between features and their attributes makes it possible to ask questions about the information in an attribute table and display the answers on the map
- Features have spatial relationships
- New features can be created from areas of overlap
