## Headings
https://www.nomensa.com/blog/2017/how-structure-headings-web-accessibility

Heading 1 is the most important and is the heading for the page, this typically corresponds to the title of the page. It gives users an indication of what the page is about - you should have a single Heading 1 on each page.

Each heading 2 creates a **section** of content. They divide pages into consumable sections which help to organize the content.

When a section is visually obvious you can hide headings from sighted users.

- Donâ€™t style text to look like a heading unless you use heading mark-up.
- The level of heading is not the same as the text size.

## Reporting accessibility issues
- Focus on conversions: focus on user workflows that lead to success
