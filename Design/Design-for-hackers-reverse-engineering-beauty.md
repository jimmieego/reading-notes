# Design for Hackers: Reverse-Engineering Beauty

David Kadavy

## Introduction

- The world is in need of design literacy.
- A hacker values knowledge and learns whatever he needs to learn to achieve his vision.
- There really is a thought process - a decision-making framework - behind design.

## Chapter 1. Why Design Matters

The layers of design: purpose, medium and technology, and aesthetic decisions.

## Chapter 2. The Purpose of Design

You don’t always need a great visual design to be successful. Be sensitive to the needs of your users, how they interact with your product, and how your product fits into the competitive landscape.

Great visual design depends upon great user experience design. Use some form of a user experience design process early on in your project. User personas, use cases, and wireframes all help you focus on the critical aspects of user experience before getting caught up in details.

## Chapter 3. Medium and Form in Typography

Evenness of weight, or *texture*, is important to the legibility and readability of typography.

*Letterfit* is the consideration given to the letterforms to allow them to be set together in an even manner.

*Kerning* is the distance between two letters, and good fonts have parameters (or *kerning tables*) set for just about every letter combination in which the font may eventually be set.

> (On Page 51) The end of a brush stroke, if the brush is simply lifted, looks awkward, so serifs were added to the letters to give them a clean look and enhance readability.

> In some Roman inscriptions, it’s likely that the chisel was the source of the serif.

The theoretical underpinnings of Roman capitals: the square, the circle, and the triangle.

Notable letters of typographic history:

- Square capitals: influenced by the pen with which they are created
- Rustic capitals: more condensed than square capitals are, and the letters are simplified a bit.
- Trajan’s Column: the letters follow the basic shapes of the square, triangle, and circle, with great consideration given to the balance between the letters themselves and the negative spaces within and between the letters.
- Half uncials
- Carolingian minuscule: the birth of what we today consider “lowercase”.
- Textura
- Gutenberg
- Jenson
- Garamond: one of the most readable typefaces available for printed media.
- Baskerville
- Bodoni: Where the strokes sharply go from thick to thin, they’re rounded with geometric precision. The self-consciousness of this typeface’s design makes it perfect for the many fashion magazines in which it is commonly used.
- Slab-serif
- Sans-serif
- Decorative type
- Art Nouveau
- Futura
- Helvetica
- Chicago: its letters are mostly composed of heavy vertical strokes that are easily rendered with pixels
- Adobe Garamond
- Georgia: arguably the most readable serif font for web use.
- Arial: arguably the most readable sans-serif font for web use.

If you were looking for an alternative to Garamond for use on the web, you’d find no better choice than Georgia. The larger x-height of Georgia makes it more readable on-screen.

Today’s screens are incompatible with subtle curvilinear form like in Garamond.

The only way for a designer or developer to ensure that she’s making the right font choice is for her to develop an understanding of the font’s intentions and the limitations of the screen technology – or whatever medium in which the design will finally be conveyed.

- Learn about the different types of typefaces, paying special attention to who designed them and how technology influenced the design.
- On today’s screens (about 100 ppi to 150 ppi), stick with web-standard fonts at sizes below 30 px.
- Feel free to use custom fonts from Typekit, Cufón, or other technologies at sizes above 30 px, but be sure that you understand the font and how best to pair it.
- Avoid using fonts designed for the screen in print applications.

## Chapter 4. Technology and Culture

Neoclassical art usually depicted scenes from ancient Greek or Roman history or mythology, painted as realistically as possible.

Avoid simply copying a graphic style, and try to understand its technological and cultural influences.

## Chapter 5. Fool’s Golden Ratio: Understanding Proportions

*Proportion* is how the size or magnitude of one thing relates to that of another related thing.

Proportional relationships help organize the various elements involved in a design, not only drawing the attention of the viewer, but guiding her eye throughout that piece of design.

Well-considered geometric relationships help make a composition interesting.

## Chapter 6. Holding the Eye: Composition and Design Principles

The term *composition* refers to the way that elements are arranged within a piece of design, the interrelationships between those elements, and – if applicable – the relationships between those elements and a canvas or display.

### Foreground/background relationships

Size, color, texture, and use of shadows are just some of the factors that can make some things pop, while others recede.

### Design principles

Dominance: The principle of dominance creates visual interest in a composition by drawing the viewer’s eye to an important element in the composition.

Similarity: Similarity means that various elements of a composition – their shape, color, line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture – are similar to one another. Similarity makes a design look cohesive, because the various elements within it echo one another.

Rhythm: The repetition of a particular design element or characteristic throughout a composition create a sense of rhythm in design.

Texture: Texture is the visual indication that something has characteristics that would be palpable if you were able to touch them.
