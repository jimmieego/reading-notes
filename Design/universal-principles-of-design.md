## Accessibility

**Inclusive Design**: Objects and environments should be designed to be usable, without modification, by as many people as possible.

There are four characteristics of accessible designs: 

- Perceptibility: when everyone can perceive the design, regardless of sensory abilities
    - redundant coding methods
    - compatibility with assistive technology
    - controls for seated and standing users
- Operability: when everyone can use the design, regardless of physical abilities
    - minimize repetitive actions and the need for substaintial physical effort
    - facilitate use of controls through good affordance and constraints
    - provide compatibility with assistive technology (e.g., wheelchair access)
    - controls for seated and standing users
- Simplicity: when everyone can easily understand and use the deisgn, regardless of experience, literacy, or concentration level
    - remove unnecessary complexity
    - clearly and consistently code and label controls and modes of operation
    - use progressive disclosure to present only relevant information and controls
    - provide clear prompting and feedback for all actions
    - ensure that reading levels accommodate a wide range of literacy
- Forgiveness: when design minimize the occurrence and consequences of errors
    - use good affordances and constraints (e.g., controls that can only be used the correct way) to prevent errors from occurring
    - use confirmations and warnings to reduce the occurrence of errors
    - include reversible actions and safety nets to minimize the consequence of errors (e.g., the ability to undo an action)
