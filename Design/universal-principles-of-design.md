## Accessibility

**Inclusive Design**: Objects and environments should be designed to be usable, without modification, by as many people as possible.

There are four characteristics of accessible designs: 

- Perceptibility: when everyone can perceive the design, regardless of sensory abilities
    - redundant coding methods
    - compatibility with assistive technology
    - controls for seated and standing users
- Operability: when everyone can use the design, regardless of physical abilities
    - minimize repetitive actions and the need for substaintial physical effort
    - facilitate use of controls through good affordance and constraints
    - provide compatibility with assistive technology (e.g., wheelchair access)
    - controls for seated and standing users
- Simplicity: when everyone can easily understand and use the deisgn, regardless of experience, literacy, or concentration level
    - remove unnecessary complexity
    - clearly and consistently code and label controls and modes of operation
    - use progressive disclosure to present only relevant information and controls
    - provide clear prompting and feedback for all actions
    - ensure that reading levels accommodate a wide range of literacy
- Forgiveness: when design minimize the occurrence and consequences of errors
    - use good affordances and constraints (e.g., controls that can only be used the correct way) to prevent errors from occurring
    - use confirmations and warnings to reduce the occurrence of errors
    - include reversible actions and safety nets to minimize the consequence of errors (e.g., the ability to undo an action)

## Area Alignment

Alignment based on the area of elements versus the edges of elements.

For example, pull quotes should be aligned based on text edge and not on the quotation marks. Numbered or bulleted items should be aligned based on the text edge and not on the numbers and bullets, unless the specific intent is to subordinate the listed items.

Consider area alignment when incorporating dissimilar elements into a composition. When objects are simple and symmetrical, align based on their edges; otherwise, align based on their areas.

## Confirmation

The message should end with one question that is structured to be answered *Yes* or *No*, or with an action verb that conveys the action to be performed. 

The use of *OK* and *Cancel* should be avoided for confirmations.

For less critical confirmations that act more like reminders, an option to disable the confirmation should be provided.

## Highlighting

Highlight no more than 10 percent of the visible design; highlighting effects are diluted as the percentage increases. Use a small number of highlighting techniques applied consistently throughout the design.

Bolding is generally preferred over other techniques (italics and underlying) as it adds minimal noise to the design and clearly highlights target elements.

## Normal Distribution

It is important to avoid trying to create something that is average in all dimensions. A person average in one measure will not be average in other measures. The probability tha a person will match the average of their population group in two measures is approximately 7 percent; this falls to less than 1 percent for eight measures. The common belief that average people exist and are the standard to which designers should design is called the "average person fallacy."

There is no *average person* in reality.

In a normal distribution, approximately 68 percent of the population falls within one standard deviation of the average; approximately 95 percent of the population falls within two standard deviations of the average; and approximately 99 percent of the population falls within three standard deviations of the average.

## Ockham's Razor

Ockham's razor asserts that simplicity is preferred to complexity in design, if functionalities are equivalent.
