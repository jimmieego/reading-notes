# Responsible Responsive Design

Scott Jehl

## Introduction

A responsible responsive design equally considers the following throughout a project:

- **Usability**: The way a website’s user interface is presented to the user, and how that UI responds to browsing conditions and user interactions.
- **Access**: The ability for users of all devices, browsers, and as- sistive technologies to access and understand a site’s features and content.
- **Sustainability**: The ability for the technology driving a site or application to work for devices that exist today and to continue to be usable and accessible to users, devices, and browsers in the future.
- **Performance**: The speed at which a site’s features and content are perceived to be delivered to the user and the efficiency with which they operate within the user interface.
