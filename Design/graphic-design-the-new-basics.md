## Formstorming
Formstorming is an act of visual thinking - a tool for designers to unlock and deepen solutions to basic design problems.

One hundred iterations: This classic exercise asks designers to choose one subject and visually interpret it in one hundred ways. 

Formstorming templates: Designers use formatted templates to mindfully conduct essential investigations.

Dailies (create a design-a-day): This ongoing generative exercise spurs design thinking through a daily creative act situated within a conceptual framework.

Process verbs: After building a solid typographic composition, designers applied a series of actions (both physical and digital) to their initial design.

Alterego: This project invites each designer to develop a fictitious persona that amplifies, undermines, or rediscovers an element of themselves and then to design through the lens of that character. 

## Point, Line, Plane
**Axonometric projections** depict volume without making elements recede into space. The result is more abstract and impersonal than linear perspective. Architects often use axonometric projections in order to keep a consistent scale across the page. 

Three objects, thirty-three ways: Designers begin by visiting an unusual place and observe. They produce a substantial number of observational drawings of three objects. Careful observation is followed by exercises in creating word lists and drawing from memory to create a total of ninety-nine studies. 

Bezier curves: A Bezier curve is a line defined by a set of anchor and control points. 

## Rhythm and Balance
In design, balance acts as a catalyst for form - it anchors and activiates elements in space.

Visual balance occurs when the weight of one or more things is distributed evenly or proportionately in space. 

A symmetrical design, which has the same elements on at least two sides along a common axis, is inherently stable. 

Rhythm is a strong, regular, repeated pattern. Although pattern design usually employs unbroken repetition, most forms of graphic design seek rhythms that are punctuated with change and variation.

Asymmetrical designs are generally more active than symmetrical ones, and designers achieve balance by placing contrasting elements in counterpoint to each other, yielding compositions that allow the eye to wander while achieving an overall stability. 

The repetition of elements such as circles, lines, and grids creates rhythm, while varying their size or intensity generates surprise. 

Keeping an element of surprise and variation is key to sustaining interest. 

## Scale
No matter what size your work will ultimately be, it must have its own sens of scale. 

Scale can be considered both objectively and subjectively. In *objective* terms, scale refers to the literal dimensions of a physical object or to the literal correlation between a representation and the real thing it depicts. 

*Subjectively*, scale refers to one's impression of an object's size. We say that an image or representation "lacks scale" when it has no cues that connect it to lived experience, giving it a physical identity. A design whose elements all have a similar size often feels dull and static, lacking contrast in scale.

Scale can depend on context. For example, 12pt type generally appears legible and appropriately scaled when viewed on a computer monitor, but the same type can feel crude and unwiedly as printed text. Developing sensitivity to scale is an ongoing process for every designer. 

When elements are all the same size, the design feels flat. Contrast in size can create a sense of tension as well as a feeling of depth and movement. Small shapes tend to recede; large ones move forward. 

Contrast in scale can imply motion or depth as well as express differences in importance. 

## Texture
In design, texture is both physical and virtual. Textures include the literal surface employed in the making of a printed piece or physical object as well as the optical appearance of that surface. Many of the textures that designer manipulate exist as optical effect and representation. 

The designer uses texture to establish a mood, reinforce a point of view, or convey a sense of physical presence. A body of text set in Garamond italic will have a delicately irregular appearance, while a text set in Univers roman will appear optically smooth with even tonality. 

## Color
Color serves to differentiate and connect, to highlight and to hide.

According to classical tradition, the essence of design lies in linear structures and tonal relationships (drawing and shading), not in fleeting optical effects (hue, intensity, luminosity). Color was seen as subjective and unstable. 

### Basic Color Theory
Colors that sit near each other on the spectrum or close together on the color wheel are *analogous*. Using them together provides minimal color contrast and an innate harmony. Analogous colors also have a related color temperature. 

Two colors sitting opposite each other on the wheel are *complements*. They have opposing temperatures (warm versus cool). 

Deciding to use analogous or contrasting colors affects the visual energy and mood of any composition.

Primary Colors:
- Red
- Yellow
- Blue

Secondary Colors:
- Orange
- Purple
- Green

Tertiary Colors: Colors such as red orange and yellow green are mixed from one primary and one secondary color.

**Hue** is the place of the color within the spectrum.

**Intensity** is the brightness or dullness of a color. A color is made duller by adding black or white, as well as by neutralizing it toward gray (lowering its saturation).

Yellow is of greatest intensity toward the lighter end of the value scale, while blue is more intense in the darker zone. 

**Value** is the light or dark character of the color, also called its luminance, brightness, lightness, or tone. Value is independent of the hue or intensity of the color. When you convert a color image to black and white, you eliminate its hue but preserve its tonal relationships.

Using colors with contrasting values tends to bring forms into sharp focus, while combining colors that are close in value softens the distinction between elements.

### Aspects of Color
**Shade** is a variation of a hue produced by the addition of black.

**Tine** is a variation of a hue produced by the addition of white.

**Saturation** (or chroma) is the relative purity of the color as it neutralizes to gray.

### Color Models
The true primaries of visible light are red, green, and blue (RGB). This is the *additive* light system.

Pigment-based color systems are called *subtractive*, for example, CMYK. 

Bezold Effect (optical mixing): Adding a darker color to the carpet would create an overall darker effect, while adding a lighter one would yield a lighter carpet. 

### Designing with Color
Many designs employ a limited number of colors that cover a range of values and color temperatures. A palette might consist of black, white, and one or two accent colors. 

By occupying a middle ground between black and white, an accent color can allow type to appear in both black and white, adding to a piece's typographic range. 

Including both warm and cool hues in a color palette creates a sense of visual completeness. 

Textile designers often create numerous colorways for a single pattern. Different color palettes make different elements of the pattern come forward or recede. 

## Gestalt Principles
Visual perception is shaped by figure/ground relationships. We separate figures (forms) from the space, color, or patterns that surround them (ground, or background).

People are accustomed to seeing the background as passive and unimportant in relation to a dominant subject. Yet visual artists become attuned to the spaces around and between elements, discovering their power to become active forms in their own right. 

Graphic designers often seek a balance between figure and ground. They build contrasts between form and counterform in order to construct icons, illustrations, logos, compositions, and patterns that stimulate the eye and mind. Creating ambiguity between figure and ground can add vsiual energy and surprise to an image or mark. 

Figure/ground, also known as positive and negative space, is at work in all facets of graphic design. The ability to create and evaluate effective figure/ground tension is an essential skill for graphic designers.

Blocking the eyes can create emotional tension.

### Grouping
In human perception, grouping serves to both combine and separate. Interface designers use the principle of grouping to color-code buttons with related functions (similarity) as well as to position related buttons close together (proximity).

Grouping prompts the observer to build parts into wholes.

A stable figure/ground relationship exists when a form or figure stands clearly apart from its background. Reverisble figure/ground occurs when positive and negative elements attract our attention equally and alternately. Active figure/ground conditions churn and interweave form and space, creating tension and ambiguity.

## Framing
Cropping, borders, margins, and captions are key resources of graphic design.

Frames create the condition for understanding an image or object. 

A well-designed interface is both visible and invisible, escaping attention when not needed while shifting into focus on demand. 

Pushing the frame into the foreground provokes the discovery of new ideas. 

The meaning and impact of an image or text changes depending on how it is bordered or cropped. 

Framing can also penetrate the image, rendering it open and permeable rather than stable and contained. A frame can divide an image from its background, but it can also serve as a transition from inside to outside, figure to ground.

Wider margins can emphasize a picture of a field of text as an object, calling out attention to it. A margin creates a protective zone around an image. A wider margin can add formality to the image it frames.  

*Full bleed*: An image "bleeds" when it runs off the edge of a page. The ground disappears, and the image seems larger and more active.

*Partial bleed*: An image can bleed off one, two, or three sides. The image still has a larger-than-life quality. 

Text over iamge: Boxes, bars, and transparent color fields are some of the ways designers deal with the problem of separating text from iamge. 

A graphic *border* can help define an image that lacks an obvious edge (a white background on a white page). A border creates a transition between image and background.

A frame can serve to either emphasize or downplay its contents. 

## Hierarchy
Hierarchy is conveyed visually, through variations in scale, value, color, spacing, placement, and other signals.

Analyzing tables of contents - as well as restaurant menus and commerical catalogs - is a valuable exercise.

## Layers
Layers are simultaneous, overlapping components of an image or sequence. 

The cut-and-paste function used in nearly every software application today refers to the physical process of collage. Foregrounding the cut-and-paste process can yield powerful results that indicate the designer's role in shaping meaning. 

Types of layers:
- Printed layers
- Typographic layers
- Data layers
- Temporal layers: From musical notation and computer interfaces to narrative plot lines, parallel linear tracks (layers in time) are a crucial means for describing simultaneous events.

## Transparency
In design, transparency is often used not for the purpose of clarity, but to create dense, layered imagery built from veils of color and texture. 

A *fade* is created by making a clip gradually become transparent. *Dissolves* occur when one clip fades out (becoming transparent) while a second clip fades in (becoming opaque).

Transparency can serve to emphasize values of directness and clarity through adjustments and juxtapositions that maintain the wholeness or legibility of elements. 

Transparency also can serve to build complexity by allowing layers to mix and merge together. 

Transparency can be used thematically to combine or contrast ideas, linking levels of content. 

To make any image transparent involves compromising its intensity, lowering its overall contrast. 

Transparency is used not only to mix two visual elements, but also to make one image fade out against its background.

## Modualarity
A module is a fixed element used within a larger system or structure. 

### Symbol Systems
A well-defined contraint can free up the thought process by taking some decisions off the table. 

A *symbol* stands for or represents objects, functions, and processes. Symbol systems are often based on geometric modules that come together to create myriad forms and functions. 

## Grid
Guidelines help the designer align elements in relation to each other. Consistent margins and columns create an underlying structure that unifies the pages of a document and makes the layout process more efficient. 

The grid offers a rationale and a starting point for each composition, converting a blank area into a structured field.

Grids help designers create active, asymmetrical compositions in place of static, centered ones. 

### Content Management
A standard narrative book is designed with a single-column grid: one block of body copy is surrounded by margins that function as a simple frame for the content. 

Large amounts of text often use a two-column grid, breaking up space and making the pages less overwhelming for readers. 

Magazines typically use grids with three or more vertical divisions. 

## Pattern
Dots, stripes, and grids provide the architecture behind an infinite range of designs. Nearly any pattern arises from three basic forms: isolated elements, linear elements, and the criss-crossing or interaction of the two.

Any isolated form can be considered a *dot*. 

A *stripe* is a linear path. 

The structural analysis of pattern is central to modern design theory. 

Dots and stripes interact to form grids. As a grid takes shape, it subverts the identity of the separate elements in favor of a larger texture. Creating that larger texture is what pattern design is all about.

## Diagram
A diagram is a graphic representation of a structure, situation, or process. 

Edward R. Tufte argues that a chart or diagram should employ no metaphoric distractions or excessive flourishes (what he called "chart junk"), but should stay within the realm of objective observation. 

A network, also called a graph, is a set of connections among nodes or points. 

*Centralized networks*: all power issues from a common point.

*Decentralized network*: has a spine with radiating elements, as in an interstate highway system.

*Distributed network*: has node-to-node relationships with no spine and no center. 

## Time and Motion
Time and motion are considerations for all design work.

It can be useful to think about the screen as an active, changing surface as well as a neutral stage or support onto which characters rush on and off. 

Basic principles fo conveying temporal change and motion, both in still and time-based media:
- Implied Motion
	- Suggest change and movement on the printed page.
	- Diagonal compositions evoke motion, while rectilinear arrangements appear static.
	- Cropping a shape can suggest motion, as does a sinuous line or a pointed, triangular shape. 
- Change Over Time
	- Position
	- Rotation
	- Scale
	- Shape
	- Color
	- Depth
	- Transparency
	- Multiple modes of change
- Animating Type (need to pay attention to legibility and reading order)
	- Change in Position: Type enters from the right side of the screen and moves left to support the normal direction of reading. 
	- Color
	- Transparency
	- Multiple modes of change

### Storyboards
Once a concept is developed, the script is fleshed out with storyboard sketches and a style frame.

Storyboards summarize the content or key moments of an animation's events. Storyboarding also determines the flow of the storyline and suggests the major changes of action. In addition to movements, the personality, emotions, and gestures of the characters and objects are also expressed. They layout of a storyboard, similar to that of a comic strip, consists of sketches or illustrations displayed sequentially to visualize an animated or live-action piece. Notes describing camera angles, soundtrack, movement, special effects, timing, and transitions between scenes are often included. 

*Style Frames*: The ultimate look of an animation is expressed in one or more style frames, which set the aesthetic tone and formal elements. A style frame captures many of the graphic elements used throughout the piece. The typography, colors, patterns, illustrations, and photographs chosen for the project are often included. 

### Beyond the Timeline
Intearctive logos and graphics are another aspect of motion design, where the interactive designer creates behaviors. 

## Rules and Randomness
Rules create a framework for design without determining the end results. 

Rules can be used to generate form as well as organize content. The designer controls and manipulates the system itself rather than the final outcome. 

Repeating and rotating forms are universal principles of pattern design.
