## Formstorming
Formstorming is an act of visual thinking - a tool for designers to unlock and deepen solutions to basic design problems.

One hundred iterations: This classic exercise asks designers to choose one subject and visually interpret it in one hundred ways. 

Formstorming templates: Designers use formatted templates to mindfully conduct essential investigations.

Dailies (create a design-a-day): This ongoing generative exercise spurs design thinking through a daily creative act situated within a conceptual framework.

Process verbs: After building a solid typographic composition, designers applied a series of actions (both physical and digital) to their initial design.

Alterego: This project invites each designer to develop a fictitious persona that amplifies, undermines, or rediscovers an element of themselves and then to design through the lens of that character.
