100 design principles for using grids

By: Beth Tondreau

## 4. Go easy on the reader

If each style doesn't have a clear purpose, many different styles can be confusing.

## 12. Design with ample margins

Depending on the number of pages in a project, some binding methods cause type to get lost in the gutters more than others.

Wide margins also act as buffers for images.

Reading is easier with generous margins and ample leading.

## 15. Design for Function

Chapter openers often have more space before the text starts (also known as a sink, or drop) than a normal text page.

Successful and balanced grid construction employs a wide column that is double the width of the narrow column. The type in the narrower column is set in the same typeface as the running text but in a lighter weight font. Using varying font weights adds rich texture.

When there are few or no images, the structure of two uneven columns can support a page with nothing in the smaller text column.

Rules can function as devices to either divide the space or connect columns within the space.

## 16. Rules Rule!

Many discrete chunks of information -> Need more than mere space between the columns for readability.

Caution: Too many rules can dull a page.

When there is a lot of informational action going on, a horizontal rule can separate a page number or a running foot from the rest of the hard-core information.

## 21. Make It Look Simple

When captions are long and contain a lot of additional information, such as credits and supplemental descriptions, distinguish the captions from the text by using different typefaces, by setting the type smaller, or by varying the amount of space between elements.

One structural solution is a three-column grid that scans like a one- or two-column design. Use two of the columns for a single text width and position the text on the right side of the page. The result is a clean look for the running text and a generous left margin for a long caption.

## 24. Lower the Columns

A full page of three-column text can become dense. A good way to keep the reader engaged and undaunted is to lower the columns on the page, which creates clean spreads and a feeling of movement.

Lowered text columns also enable the designer to create a clear area for lead information such as the running head and page number, spread title, head- note, and photos.

## 42. Determine a Palette

Determining a controlled palette can provide coherence. When the function of color is to grab attention, it makes sense to use bright colors. When color is used to serve more serious text such as a case study or financial report, a palette can be more muted (less saturated) to better serve the content.

## 43. Let the Color Be the Information

Using a limited amount of color (e.g., black) to offset highly saturated images allows the reader to focus on the point of the image. Too much visual competition is counterproductive.
