100 design principles for using grids

By: Beth Tondreau

## 4. Go easy on the reader

If each style doesn't have a clear purpose, many different styles can be confusing.

## 12. Design with ample margins

Depending on the number of pages in a project, some binding methods cause type to get lost in the gutters more than others.

Wide margins also act as buffers for images.

Reading is easier with generous margins and ample leading.

## 15. Design for Function

Chapter openers often have more space before the text starts (also known as a sink, or drop) than a normal text page.

Successful and balanced grid construction employs a wide column that is double the width of the narrow column. The type in the narrower column is set in the same typeface as the running text but in a lighter weight font. Using varying font weights adds rich texture.

When there are few or no images, the structure of two uneven columns can support a page with nothing in the smaller text column.

Rules can function as devices to either divide the space or connect columns within the space.

## 16. Rules Rule!

Many discrete chunks of information -> Need more than mere space between the columns for readability.

Caution: Too many rules can dull a page.

When there is a lot of informational action going on, a horizontal rule can separate a page number or a running foot from the rest of the hard-core information.
