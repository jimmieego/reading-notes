## 8. Responsive design

Three key principles to responsive design:

1. *A mobile first approach to design*. This means you build the mobile version before you construct the desktop layout.
2. *The `@media` at-rule*. Use media queries to progressively enhance the page at larger and larger viewports.
3. *The use of fluid layouts*. This approach allows containers to scale to different sizes based on the width of the viewport. Use responsive images to fit the bandwidth limitation of mobile devices.

### Mobile first

A mobile-first approach means the type of media query you’ll use the most should be `min-width`. You’ll write your mobile styles first, outside of any media queries. Then you’ll work your way up to larger breakpoints.

When designing for mobile touchscreen devices, be sure to make all the key action items large enough to easily tap with a finger. Don’t make your users zoom in in order to tap precisely on a tiny button or link.

The vieweport `meta` tag: An HTML tag that tells mobile devices you’ve intentionally designed for small screens.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### Media queries

Example:

```css
@media (min-width: 560px) {
  .title > h1 {
    font-size: 2.25rem;
  }
}
```

Use `and` to join two clauses:

```css
@media (min-width: 20em) and (max-width: 35em) { ... }
```

Use comma for one of multiple criteria (OR):

```css
@media (max-width: 20em), (min-width: 35em) { ... }
```

Target a high resolution (retina) display:

```css
@media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
       (min-resolution: 192dpi) { ... }
```

You can also place a media query in the `<link>` tag. Example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 45em)" href="large-screen.css" />
```

The stylesheet will always download, regardless of the width of the viewport, so this is merely a tactic for code organization, not network traffic reduction.

Note:

- Use `em`s for media query breakpoints. It’s the only unit that performs consistently in all major browsers should the user zoom the page or change the default font size. `px`- and `rem`-based breakpoints are less reliable in Safari. `Em`s also have the benefit of scaling up or down with the user’s default font size, which is generally preferable.
- Make sure each media query always comes after the styles it overrides, so the styles within the media query take precedence.

#### Print styles

Apply basic print styles inside of a `@media print {...}` media query:

- Use `display: none` to hide non-essential parts of the page, such as navigational menus and footers.
- Globally change font colors to black and remove all background images and colors behind blocks of text.
  
  ```css
  @media print {
    * {
      color: black !important;
      background: none !important;
    }
  }
  ```

### Fluid layouts

Fluid layout (liquid layout) refers to the use of containers that grow and shrink according to the width of the viewport. Think of container widths in percentages rather than in any fixed size.

#### Forcing a responsive table layout

```css
table {
  width: 100%;
}

@media (max-width: 30em) {
  table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td {
    display: block; /* Makes all table elements block display */
  }

  thead tr {
    position: absolute;
    top: -9999px;
    left: -9999px; /* Hides the headings row by moving it off the screen */
  }

  tr {
    margin-bottom: 1em; /* Adds a little space between each set of table data */
  }
}
```

### Responsive images

Use media queries to serve the correct sized image when the image is included via CSS.

For inlined images using `<img>`, use the `srcset` attribute to specify multiple image URLs for one `<img>` tag for different resolutions. The browser will then figure out which image it needs and download that one.

Example:

```html
<img alt="A white coffee mug on a bed of coffee beans"
     src="coffee-beans-small.jpg"
     srcset="coffee-beans-small.jpg 560w,
             coffee-beans-medium.jpg 800w,
             coffee-beans.jpg 1280w"
/>
```

Always ensure images don't overflow their container's width:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
