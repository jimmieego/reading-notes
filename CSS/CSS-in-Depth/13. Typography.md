## Typography

Web fonts use the `@font-face` at-rule to tell the browser where it can find and download custom fonts for use on a page.

### Web fonts

The `font-family` defines the name youâ€™ll use to reference this font elsewhere in your stylesheet. The `src:` provides a comma-separated list of locations where the browser will look.

### Body copy spacing

`line-height`: controls the space between lines of text (verticially).

`letter-spacing`: controls the distance between individual characters (horizontally).

The initial value for the line-height property is the keyword `normal`, which is equal to about 1.2. For body copy, a value between 1.4 and 1.6 is usually closer to ideal.

Longer lines of text should have a larger line height. Ideally, you should aim for line lengths that hold between 45 and 75 characters per line, as this is generally considered the most easily readable.

For `letter-spacing`, generally change it in increments of 1/100ths of an em. For example, `letter-spacing: 0.01em`.

### Headings, small elements, and spacing

Use a negative letter spacing to compress text in short headings.

Text set in all caps generally looks better with a larger letter spacing.
