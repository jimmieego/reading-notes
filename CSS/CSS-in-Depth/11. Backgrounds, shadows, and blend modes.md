## Backgrounds, shadows, and blend modes

### Gradients

#### Linear gradients

A basic linear gradient:

```css
.fade {
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white, blue); /* angle, starting color, and ending color */
}
```

Angle: `0deg` is equivalent to `to top`. Higher values move clockwise around the circle: `90deg` points to the right, `180deg` points down, and `360deg` points up again.

A gradient can accept any number of color stops, each separated by a comma.

You can also explicitly set the position of the color stops in the gradient function: `linear-gradient(90deg, red 0%, white 50%, blue 100%)`. Color stops don’t need to be measured in percentages. Pixels, ems, and other length units are perfectly valid.

#### Radial gradients

A basic example:

```css
.fade {
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
    background-image: radial-gradient(white, blue);
}
```

### Shadows

`box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 1px black`: offset (x), offset (y), blur radius, spread radius, color.

The larger a shadow’s offset, the further it “lifts” the image from the page, making the image seem deeper.

`box-shadow: inset 0 0 0.5em #124`: `inset` makes the shadow appear inside the border of the element, rather than outside.

### Blend modes

The background image property accepts any number of values, each separated by a comma: 

```css
background-image: url(bear.jpg), linear-gradient(to bottom, #57b, #148);
```

With mutliple background images, those listed first render in front of those listed afterward.

#### Example: Tint an image

```css
.blend {
    min-height: 400px;
    background-image: url("images/bear.jpg");
    background-color: #148;
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-blend-mode: luminosity;
}
```

Use a grayscale image to artificially add film grain or some other texture to the image.

The luminosity blend mode takes the luminosity from the front layer (the bear image) and blends it with the hue and saturation from the back layer (the blue back- ground color).

The color blend mode is effectively an inverse of luminosity, taking the hue and saturation from the front layer, while luminosity is taken from the back.

#### Example: Add texture to an image

```css
.blend {
  min-height: 400px;
  background-image: url("images/scratches.png"), url("images/bear.jpg");
  background-size: 200px, cover;
  background-repeat: repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-blend-mode: soft-light;
}
```

#### Blend modes in five basic categories

|Type of effect|Blend modes|Description|
|---|---|--|
|Darken|`multiply`|The lighter the front color, the more the base color will show through.|
|Darken|`darken`|Selects darker of the two colors.|
|Darken|`color-burn`|Darkens the base color, increasing contrast.|
|Lighten|`screen`|The darker the front color, the more the base color will show through.|
|Lighten|`lighten`|Selects the lighter of the colors.|
|Lighten|`color-dodge`|Lightens base color, decreasing contrast.|
|Contrast|`overlay`|Increases contrast by applying `multiply` to dark colors and `screen` to light colors, at half strength.|
|Contrast|`hard-light`|Greatly increases contrast. Like `overlay`, but applies `multiply` or `screen` at full strength.|
|Contrast|`soft-light`|Similar to `hard-light`, but uses `burn`/`dodge` instead of `multiply`/`screen`.|
|Composite|`hue`|Applies hue from the top color onto the bottom color.|
|Composite|`saturation`|Applies saturation from the top color onto the bottom color.|
|Composite|`luminosity`|Applies luminosity from the top color onto the bottom color.|
|Composite|`color`|Applies hue and saturation from the top color onto the bottom color.|
|Comparative|`difference`|Subtracts the darker color from the lighter one.|
|Comparative|`exclusion`|Similar to `difference`, with less contrast.|
