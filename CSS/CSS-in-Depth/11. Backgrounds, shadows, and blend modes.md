### Gradients

#### Linear gradients

A basic linear gradient:

```css
.fade {
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white, blue); /* angle, starting color, and ending color */
}
```

Angle: `0deg` is equivalent to `to top`. Higher values move clockwise around the circle: `90deg` points to the right, `180deg` points down, and `360deg` points up again.

A gradient can accept any number of color stops, each separated by a comma.

You can also explicitly set the position of the color stops in the gradient function: `linear-gradient(90deg, red 0%, white 50%, blue 100%)`. Color stops donâ€™t need to be measured in percentages. Pixels, ems, and other length units are perfectly valid.

#### Radial gradients

A basic example:

```css
.fade {
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
    background-image: radial-gradient(white, blue);
}
```
