# CSS in Depth

## 1. Cascade, specificity, and inheritance

### Cascade

When declarations conflict, the cascade considers three things to resolve the difference:

1. *Stylesheet origin* — Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser’s default styles.
2. *Selector specificity* — Which selectors take precedence over which.
3. *Source order* — Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.

#### Stylesheet origin

1. Author important (`!important` added to the end of declaration)
2. Author
3. User agent

#### Specificity

- Inline styles have no selector because they are applied directly to the element they target. To override inline declarations in your stylesheet, you’ll need to add an `!important` to the declaration, shifting it into a higher-priority origin. If the inline styles are marked important, then nothing can override them. It’s preferable to do this from within the stylesheet.
- Selector specificity (ID > Class > Tag):
  - If a selector has more IDs, it wins.
  - If that results in a tie, the selector with the most classes wins. 
  - If that results in a tie, the selector with the most tag names wins.

Notes:

- Pseudo-class selectors (for example, `:hover`) and attribute selectors (for example, `[type="input"]`) each have the same specificity as a class selector. The universal selector (`*`) and combinators (`>`, `+`, `~`) have no effect on specificity.
- If you need to override a style applied using an ID, you have to use another ID.
- It is generally best to keep specificity low when you can, so when you need to override something, your options are open.

#### Source order

If the origin and the specificity are the same, then the declaration that appears later in the stylesheet—or appears in a stylesheet included later on the page—takes precedence.

### Two rules of thumb

1. Don't use IDs in your selector.
2. Don't use `!important`.

Include a stylesheet for your component. If your component needs to make style changes dynamically, it's almost always preferable to use JavaScript to add and remove classes to the elements.

### Inheritance

If an element has no cascaded value for a given property, it may inherit one from an ancestor element.

Primarily properties pertaining to text, list properties, and table border properties are inherited.
