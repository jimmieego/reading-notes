## [4 Practical Tips for Building Your Design Portfolio](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/4-practical-tips-for-building-your-design-portfolio--cms-28976)
Tell a story with each project. Keep the sequence of your design process clear and organized. Remember, every story has a beginning, middle and end. Show the context, your design iteration and the design decision-making process.

As an extension of the first point, focus on why you made design decisions (whether that be justification through design principles or user data). Provide the relevant context, the problem, your solution, and for bonus points, explain what you would do differently and what you learned from the process.

Start by having of a perspective of a brand. Determine what differentiates you from every other candidate as you apply for a certain job. Consider tweaking your resume to highlight your appropriate strengths for a role. 

Highlight your unique strengths; whether those be photography, illustration, writing, front-end skills and so on.

Design is a visual medium. So while having context is valuable, make sure you show stages of progression and have a final solution that you are willing to stand behind and defend. Don’t show work you’re not proud of. 

# White space
## [How To Use Space In Design](http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/design-space/)
Whitespace does three main things in a design:
1. Creates groupings of elements
2. Creates emphasis and hierarchy
3. Improves legibility

Space in web design can be divided into to types: 
1. **Micro whitespace** – is the space within elements, such as the margins surrounding text and the leading between lines of text or the spaces between the individual characters. 
2. **Macro whitespace** – is the space between major elements in your design. These spaces tend to be larger and are usually immediately apparent.

Boxes can be overkill. Yes, they work well at separating things, but they do it too well and can sometimes harm the overall unity of the page. Space can be used instead of boxes to separate and connect.
